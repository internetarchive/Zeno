# Zeno
State-of-the-art web crawler ðŸ”±

## Introduction

Zeno is a web crawler designed to operate wide crawls or to simply archive one web page.
Zeno's key concepts are: portability, performance, simplicity.
With an emphasis on performance.

It has been originally developed by [Corentin Barreau](https://github.com/CorentinB) at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org).
It heavily relies on the [warc](https://github.com/CorentinB/warc) module for traffic recording into [WARC](https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/) files.

The name Zeno comes from Zenodotus (Î–Î·Î½ÏŒÎ´Î¿Ï„Î¿Ï‚), a Greek grammarian, literary critic, Homeric scholar,
and the first librarian of the Library of Alexandria.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/internetarchive/Zeno@latest
```

## Quick Start

To archive a single web page:
```bash
Zeno get url https://www.france.fr
```

Zeno is highly configurable with many parameters that can be customized. To see all available configuration options, use `Zeno -h` and/or `Zeno get -h`.
