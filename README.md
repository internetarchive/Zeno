# Zeno
State-of-the-art web crawler ðŸ”±

## Introduction

Zeno is a web crawler designed to operate wide crawls or to simply archive one web page.
Zeno's key concepts are: portability, performance, simplicity.
With an emphasis on performance.

It heavily relies on the [gowarc](https://github.com/internetarchive/gowarc) module for traffic recording into [WARC](https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/) files.

The name Zeno comes from Zenodotus (Î–Î·Î½ÏŒÎ´Î¿Ï„Î¿Ï‚), a Greek grammarian, literary critic, Homeric scholar,
and the first librarian of the Library of Alexandria.

## Requirements

- **Go 1.25+** - As specified in go.mod
- **GCC 12+** - Required for building C++ dependencies with C++20 constexpr support
- **CGO enabled** - This project requires C++ compilation (CGO_ENABLED=1) due to Go bindings for Ada, the WHATWG URL parser ([github.com/ada-url/goada](https://github.com/ada-url/goada)). We hope to move away from this dependency to a pure Go alternative in the future.

Note: GCC 11 and earlier versions do not support the C++20 constexpr features required by the ada-url/goada dependency. On Ubuntu 22 LTS and earlier, you may need to install a newer GCC version.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/internetarchive/Zeno@latest
```

or utilize our pre-built [release binaries here](https://github.com/internetarchive/Zeno/releases), but do note that we are mainly focused on linux/amd64 support at this time.

## Quick Start

To archive a single web page:
```bash
Zeno get url https://www.france.fr
```

Zeno is highly configurable with many parameters that can be customized. To see all available configuration options, use `Zeno -h` and/or `Zeno get -h`.
