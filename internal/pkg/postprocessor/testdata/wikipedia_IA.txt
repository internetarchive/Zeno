On June 1, 2020, four large publishing houses – [[Hachette Book Group]], [[Penguin Random House]], [[HarperCollins]], and [[Wiley (publisher)|John Wiley]] – filed [[Hachette v. Internet Archive|a lawsuit against the Internet Archive]] before the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], claiming that the Internet Archive's practice of [[controlled digital lending]] constituted [[copyright infringement]].

===Internet Archive Scholar===
{{Main|Internet Archive Scholar}}
In September 2020, Internet Archive announced a new initiative to archive and preserve [[open access]] academic journals, called [[Internet Archive Scholar]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Internet Archive Will Digitize & Preserve Millions of Academic Articles with Its New Database, 'Internet Archive Scholar'|url=http://www.openculture.com/2020/09/internet-archive-scholar.html |date=September 22, 2020 |access-date=2020-09-23 |website=Open Culture|language=en-US|archive-date=September 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922161701/http://www.openculture.com/2020/09/internet-archive-scholar.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bryan|first=Newbold|date=2021-03-09|title=Search Scholarly Materials Preserved in the Internet Archive|url=https://blog.archive.org/2021/03/09/search-scholarly-materials-preserved-in-the-internet-archive/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Internet Archive Scholar [homepage&#93; |url=https://scholar.archive.org/ |publisher=Internet Archive |access-date=24 March 2022}}</ref> Its full-text search index includes over 25&nbsp;million research articles and other scholarly documents preserved in the Internet Archive. The collection spans from digitized copies of eighteenth century journals through the latest open access conference proceedings and pre-prints crawled from the World Wide Web.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

=== General Index ===
In 2021, the Internet Archive announced the initial version of the [[General Index (academia)|General Index]], a publicly available [[Index (publishing)|index]] to a collection of 107&nbsp;million academic [[Article (publishing)|journal article]]s.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Else|first=Holly|date=2021-10-26|title=Giant, free index to world's research papers released online|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02895-8|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/d41586-021-02895-8|pmid=34703019|s2cid=240000069|access-date=November 12, 2021|archive-date=November 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211113162341/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02895-8|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title="The General Index": New tool allows you to search 107 million research papers for free|url=https://bigthink.com/the-present/general-index-open-access/|access-date=2021-11-12|website=Big Think|date=November 5, 2021 |language=en-US|archive-date=November 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211112214225/https://bigthink.com/the-present/general-index-open-access/|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Items and collections ==
The Archive stores [[computer file|files]] inside so-called items, which are similar to [[Directory (computing)|directories]] in that they can contain multiple files, but can have additional [[metadata]] such as a description and tags which make them more searchable.

Some file types can be previewed directly on the site, where as others have to be downloaded in order to be opened. If multiple multimedia files exist in an item, the website generates a playlist for video or audio files, or a slide show for pictures. If an item contains at least one video or picture, the Archive generates a preview [[thumbnail]] that can be seen on collection pages and in searches. Items can contain mixed data such as music files with an album cover picture, in which case the picture is used as thumbnail.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://help.archive.org/help/how-to-upload-files-to-create-a-new-item-page/ |access-date=2024-10-22 |title=How to upload files to create a new item page – Internet Archive Help Center }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://help.archive.org/help/movies-and-videos-tips-troubleshooting/ |access-date=2024-10-22 |title=Movies and Videos – Tips & Troubleshooting – Internet Archive Help Center }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://help.archive.org/help/media-players-a-basic-guide/ |title=Media Players – A Basic Guide – Internet Archive Help Center |access-date=2024-10-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://help.archive.org/help/archive-org-page-overview/ |title=Archive.org page overview – Internet Archive Help Center |access-date=2024-10-22 }}</ref>

{{As of|2013|July}}, the Internet Archive was operating 33 [[book scanning|scanning centers]] in five countries, digitizing about 1,000 books a day for a total of more than 2&nbsp;million books, in a total collection of 4.4&nbsp;million books{{snd}}including material digitized by others and fed into the Internet Archive; at that time, users were performing more than 15&nbsp;million downloads per month.<ref name=Hoffelder2013/>

The material digitized by others includes more than 300,000 books that were contributed to the collection, between about 2006 and 2008, by [[Microsoft]] through its [[Live Search Books]] project, which also included financial support and scanning equipment directly donated to the Internet Archive.<ref name=msdown>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/livesearch/archive/2008/05/23/book-search-winding-down.aspx |title=Book search winding down |date=May 23, 2008 |work= MSDN Live Search Blog<!-- Official announcement from Microsoft-->|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820220749/http://blogs.msdn.com/livesearch/archive/2008/05/23/book-search-winding-down.aspx |archive-date=August 20, 2008}}</ref> On May 23, 2008, Microsoft announced it would be ending its Live Book Search project and would no longer be scanning books, donating its remaining scanning equipment to its former partners.<ref name=msdown/>

As all the other books in the collection, they also provide OCR text and images in open formats, particularly [[DjVu]], which Google Books does not offer.}} Brewster Kahle revealed in 2013 that this archival effort was coordinated by [[Aaron Swartz]], who, with a "bunch of friends", downloaded the public domain books from Google slowly enough and from enough computers to stay within Google's restrictions. They did this to ensure public access to the [[public domain]]. The Archive ensured the items were attributed and linked back to Google, which never complained, while libraries "grumbled".

In October 2024, the Internet Archive agreed to accept the paper copies of 400,000 uncatalogued dissertations from the [[Leiden University Library]], from the period 1851–2004, that the library wanted to dispose of. The University had received them from foreign Universities as part of a dissertation exchange program that had begun with its foundation in 1575, continuing for nearly 430 years. The Archive plans to digitise them and make them accessible online. The original full collection included theses by [[Niels Bohr]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Carl Jung]], [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], [[Max Planck]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Gustav Stresemann]] and [[Max Weber]].<ref>{{citation |last=Funnekotter |first=Bart |title=Leidse proefschriften worden tóch niet vernietigd, 400.000 dissertaties gaan naar de VS |trans-title=Leiden dissertations not destroyed after all, 400,000 dissertations go to the US |newspaper=[[NRC (newspaper)|NRC]] |date=October 9, 2024 |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2024/10/09/leidse-proefschriften-worden-toch-niet-vernietigd-400000-dissertaties-gaan-naar-de-vs-a4868698 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241009111945/https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2024/10/09/leidse-proefschriften-worden-toch-niet-vernietigd-400000-dissertaties-gaan-naar-de-vs-a4868698 |archive-date=October 9, 2024}}</ref>

The Internet Archive blacked out its web site for 12 hours on January 18, 2012, in protest of the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and the [[PROTECT IP Act]] [[Bill (law)|bills]], two pieces of legislation in the [[United States Congress]] that they argued would "negatively affect the ecosystem of web publishing that led to the emergence of the Internet Archive". This occurred in conjunction with the [[Protests against SOPA and PIPA#Wikimedia community|English Wikipedia blackout]], as well as [[Protests against SOPA and PIPA|numerous other protests]] across the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.archive.org/2012/01/17/12-hours-dark-internet-archive-vs-censorship/ |title=12 Hours Dark: Internet Archive vs. Censorship |last=Kahle |first=Brewster |date=January 17, 2012 |work=Internet Archive Blogs |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813030617/https://blog.archive.org/2012/01/17/12-hours-dark-internet-archive-vs-censorship/ |archive-date=August 13, 2014 }}</ref>

On October 9, 2016, the Internet Archive was temporarily blocked in [[Turkey]] after it was used (amongst other file hosting services) by hackers to host 17&nbsp;GB of leaked government emails.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turkey restores access to Google Drive after blocking cloud storage services|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-restores-access-to-google-drive-after-blocking-cloud-storage-services.aspx?pageID=238&nID=104784&NewsCatID=339|website=Turkey Blocks| date=October 10, 2016 |access-date=October 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924185119/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-restores-access-to-google-drive-after-blocking-cloud-storage-services.aspx?pageID=238&nID=104784&NewsCatID=339|archive-date=September 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2017/turkey|title=Turkey Country Report &#124; Freedom on the Net 2017|date=November 14, 2017|website=freedomhouse.org|access-date=December 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227084718/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2017/turkey|archive-date=December 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Because the Internet Archive only lightly moderates uploads, it includes resources that may be valued by extremists and the site may be used by them to evade [[Blacklist (computing)|block list]]ing.

===2020 National Emergency Library===
In the midst of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] which closed many schools, universities, and libraries, the Archive announced on March 24, 2020, that it was creating the National Emergency Library by removing the lending restrictions it had in place for 1.4&nbsp;million digitized books in its Open Library but otherwise limiting users to the number of books they could check out and enforcing their return; normally, the site would only allow one digital lending for each physical copy of the book they had, by use of an [[encryption|encrypted file]] that would become unusable after the lending period was completed.<ref name="NYT-20230813" /> This Library would remain as such until at least June 30, 2020, or until the US national emergency was over, whichever came later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/03/internet-archive-offers-thousands-of-copyrighted-books-for-free-online/|title=Internet Archive offers 1.4 million copyrighted books for free online|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|date=2020-03-28|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-10|archive-date=March 28, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200328195723/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/03/internet-archive-offers-thousands-of-copyrighted-books-for-free-online/ |url-status=live}}</ref> At launch, the Internet Archive allowed authors and rightholders to submit opt-out requests for their works to be omitted from the National Emergency Library.<ref name="ArchiveResponse">{{Cite web |title=Internet Archive responds: Why we released the National Emergency Library |url=https://blog.archive.org/2020/03/30/internet-archive-responds-why-we-released-the-national-emergency-library/ |last=Freeland |first=Chris |date=2020-03-30 |website=Internet Archive Blogs |language=en-US |access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.wired.com/story/the-national-emergency-library-and-its-discontents/ | title = The National Emergency Library and Its Discontents | first = Noam | last = Cohen | date = April 20, 2020 | access-date = April 20, 2020 | magazine = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | archive-date = April 20, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200420142718/https://www.wired.com/story/the-national-emergency-library-and-its-discontents/ | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name = an>{{Cite web |title=Internet Archive accused of using Covid-19 as 'an excuse for piracy' |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/30/internet-archive-accused-of-using-covid-19-as-an-excuse-for-piracy |last=Flood |first=Alison |date=2020-03-30 |website=The Guardian |language= en-GB |access-date=2020-05-26 |archive-date=March 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331001559/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/30/internet-archive-accused-of-using-covid-19-as-an-excuse-for-piracy |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Internet Archive said the National Emergency Library addressed an "unprecedented global and immediate need for access to reading and research material" due to the closures of physical libraries worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Announcing a National Emergency Library to Provide Digitized Books to Students and the Public |url=http://blog.archive.org/2020/03/24/announcing-a-national-emergency-library-to-provide-digitized-books-to-students-and-the-public/ |last=Freeland |first=Chris |date=2020-03-24 |website=Internet Archive Blogs |language=en-US |access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> They justified the move in a number of ways. Legally, they said they were promoting access to those inaccessible resources, which they claimed was an exercise in [[fair use]] principles. The Archive continued implementing their [[controlled digital lending]] policy that predated the National Emergency Library, meaning they still encrypted the lent copies and it was no easier for users to create new copies of the books than before. An ultimate determination of whether or not the National Emergency Library constituted fair use could only be made by a court. Morally, they also pointed out that the Internet Archive was a registered library like any other, that they either paid for the books themselves or received them as donations, and that lending through libraries predated copyright restrictions.<ref name="ArchiveResponse"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Digitization 101: The National Emergency Library |url=http://hurstassociates.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-national-emergency-library.html |last=Hurst-Wahl |first=Jill |date=2020-04-20 |website=Digitization 101 |access-date=2020-05-26 |archive-date=May 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200531053252/http://hurstassociates.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-national-emergency-library.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In November 2005, free downloads of [[Grateful Dead]] concerts were removed from the site, following what seemed to be disagreements between some of the former band members.

=== Music publishers' lawsuit ===
{{main|Universal Music Group v. Internet Archive}}
In August 2023, the [[music industry]] corporations [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG), [[Sony Music]] and [[Concord (entertainment company)|Concord]] sued the Internet Archive over its Great 78 Project, asserting the project was engaged in copyright infringement. The Great 78 Project stores digitized versions of pre-1972 songs and albums from 78&nbsp;rpm [[phonograph record]]s, for "the preservation, research and discovery of 78rpm records." The project had started in 2016, when pre-1972 recordings had not been protected by copyright; in 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Music Modernization Act]] (MMA) which enabled [[Legal remedy|legal remedies]] for unauthorised use of pre-1972 recordings until 2067, thus effectively covering them with copyright.<ref name="MIP">{{cite news |title=Internet Archive could face major hurdles in latest case |work=[[Managing Intellectual Property]] |date=August 17, 2023 |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2865693633|id={{ProQuest|2865693633}} }}</ref>
